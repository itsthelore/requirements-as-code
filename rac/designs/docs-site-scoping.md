# Docs Site Scoping — Lore Documentation Website

## Context

Lore's documentation currently lives in two places: a long README that acts
as the only public entry point, and nine task-oriented guides under `docs/`
that are readable only as raw Markdown on GitHub. A documentation website
gives the product a real front door — a landing page modelled on
openspec.dev's structure (hero → what it is → install → links into docs) and
a browsable docs section with navigation and search — built from the same
repository Markdown that is already reviewed with code.

The site is itself managed under Lore's own artifact model: this design
artifact scopes the work, requirement artifacts (Phase 2) will govern it, and
nothing is built until those artifacts are approved. Dogfooding is a hard
requirement of the project, not a nice-to-have.

Decisions fixed before scoping (not re-evaluated here):

- Static site generator: MkDocs with the Material theme.
- Content source: the existing `docs/` Markdown files, unrewritten. Nav
  reorganization and a new index page are allowed.
- Shape: one landing page plus one docs section with sidebar nav and search.
- Deployment: GitHub Actions workflow → GitHub Pages, from this repository.

Two places where the project brief and the repository disagree; the
repository is the source of truth:

1. **The brief described five docs pages; `docs/` contains nine** —
   `quickstart.md`, `cli.md`, `mcp.md`, `artifacts.md`, `relationships.md`,
   plus `repo-workflow.md`, `testing.md`, `examples.md`, and `ecosystem.md`.
   All nine go into the site nav.
2. **The brief asked for a README reduced to badges, one paragraph, install,
   and a site link.** That conflicts with ADR-022 and
   REQ-Documentation-Structure (FR-001), which require the README doorway to
   also carry intended users, a minimal usage example, common commands, and
   project status. The maintainer has ruled: ADR-022's README shape stands;
   the brief's stricter minimization is overridden. The README diff plan
   below reflects this.

ADR-022 names its own review trigger — "when introducing external
documentation hosting" — and this project fires it. The site does not change
where canonical documentation lives (repository Markdown remains
authoritative; the site is a generated view), but Phase 2 MUST include an
ADR-022 amendment or companion decision recording the hosting model and the
drift-prevention policy defined here.

Roadmap placement: the corpus convention is one roadmap artifact per release
in `rac/roadmaps/v0.10.x-guide/`. Slots v0.10.4–v0.10.6 are taken (the
"next up: v0.10.4" note in CLAUDE.md is stale), so Phase 2 should target
**v0.10.7** for this work.

## User Need

- **A prospective user** evaluating Lore needs to understand what it is, who
  it is for, and how to install it within a minute — without reading raw
  Markdown on GitHub. The landing page serves this need.
- **A new user** following the README's doorway needs a guided path —
  quickstart, MCP setup, CLI reference — with navigation and search instead
  of jumping between blob URLs.
- **The maintainer** needs README and site to stay consistent without manual
  reconciliation, and needs the site governed by the same artifact model as
  everything else in the repository.

## Design

### Site map

Every page on the site, its source file, and its nav position. Nav is flat
(one docs section), ordered by user journey: get started, connect the agent,
look things up, go deeper, contribute.

| Nav position | Nav label | Page H1 | Source file |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 (Home) | Home | Lore landing page | `docs/index.md` (new) |
| 2 | Quickstart | Quickstart | `docs/quickstart.md` |
| 3 | MCP Server | RAC Guide — MCP Server | `docs/mcp.md` |
| 4 | CLI Reference | CLI Reference | `docs/cli.md` |
| 5 | Artifacts | Artifacts | `docs/artifacts.md` |
| 6 | Relationships | Relationships | `docs/relationships.md` |
| 7 | Repository Workflow | Repository Workflow | `docs/repo-workflow.md` |
| 8 | Examples | Examples | `docs/examples.md` |
| 9 | Ecosystem | Ecosystem | `docs/ecosystem.md` |
| 10 | Testing & Contributing | Testing & Contributing | `docs/testing.md` |

Positions 2–4 mirror the README's current Documentation list order
(quickstart, mcp, cli) so the doorway and the site agree on what matters
first. No existing page is renamed, split, or rewritten.

### Landing page wireframe (`docs/index.md`)

Material-themed home page; stock theme capabilities first, custom HTML/CSS
only if an acceptance criterion is unreachable without it. Section order,
top to bottom:

1. **Hero.** The Lore header art — light and dark variants
   (`lore-header-light.png` / `lore-header-dark.png`, served from
   `docs/images/`, shown per the active color scheme) — with the existing
   alt text ("Lore — agents that know why. Deterministic. Read-only. No
   RAG, no guessing.") and the existing tagline as the headline: *"Give
   your coding agent the decisions your team already made — so it stops
   re-doing things you ruled out."*
2. **Install.** `pip install requirements-as-code` in a copyable code block,
   with the `uv tool install` alternative and the Python 3.11+ requirement
   on one line beneath.
3. **What it is.** Two short paragraphs relocated from the README: the
   agent-grounding value proposition, and the Lore-product / RAC-engine
   naming (per ADR-036: Lore is the product, RAC is the engine, everything
   ships under the `rac` name).
4. **Three primary links.** Quickstart, MCP Server, CLI Reference — the
   above-the-fold paths into the docs section.
5. **Why this works.** Relocated from the README's "Why this works" section.
6. **How this relates to spec-driven development.** Relocated from the
   README: the SDD positioning paragraph and the Lore/Spec Kit/OpenSpec
   comparison table, including its sources comment.
7. **How Lore earns trust.** Relocated from the README's trust section
   (read-only server, no AI in core, dogfooding, output contracts,
   opt-in telemetry).
8. **Footer links.** GitHub repository, project status one-liner,
   CONTRIBUTING, MIT license.

Sections 1–4 constitute the above-the-fold contract at desktop width; 5–8
are the below-the-fold depth that the README sheds.

### File-level change list

Every file created or modified:

| File | Change | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `mkdocs.yml` | new | Site config: site name, `site_url` `https://tcballard.github.io/requirements-as-code/`, `repo_url`, Material theme with light/dark palettes, built-in search, explicit nav per the site map. |
| `.github/workflows/docs.yml` | new | Build `mkdocs build --strict` on push to `main` and deploy to GitHub Pages via the official `actions/configure-pages`, `upload-pages-artifact`, `deploy-pages` actions; strict mode fails the build on broken nav or links. |
| `docs/index.md` | new | The landing page per the wireframe above. |
| `README.md` | modified | Reduced to the ADR-022 doorway per the diff plan below. |
| `docs/images/lore-header-light.png` | new (copy) | Hero art must live under `docs/` because MkDocs serves only the docs dir; copied from `rac/assets/images/`, which stays canonical for the README. |
| `docs/images/lore-header-dark.png` | new (copy) | Dark-scheme variant of the above. |
| `docs/ecosystem.md` | modified (links only) | Three `../` links out of the docs tree (`rac/`, `.claude/skills/`, `examples/guide/`) become absolute GitHub URLs so the strict build passes. |
| `docs/mcp.md` | modified (link only) | One `../examples/guide/` link becomes an absolute GitHub URL. |
| `docs/repo-workflow.md` | modified (link only) | One `../rac/decisions/adr-022...` link becomes an absolute GitHub URL. |
| `docs/testing.md` | modified (links only) | Two `../rac/...` links become absolute GitHub URLs. |
| `rac/` (Phase 2) | new artifacts | Requirements, relationships, v0.10.7 roadmap entry, and the ADR-022 amendment — scoped in Phase 2, listed here only for traceability. |

The seven link conversions across four docs files are the only edits to
existing docs content, and they change link targets, not prose. No other
docs page is touched.

### README diff plan

Measured against ADR-022's required doorway contents (product summary,
intended users, installation, minimal usage example, common commands, links
to deeper documentation, project status).

**Stays in README:**

- H1, `mcp-name` comment, hero `<picture>` element, all four badges.
- The tagline blockquote and a condensed product summary (what Lore does,
  one short paragraph) including the Lore/RAC naming sentence.
- Install: `pip install requirements-as-code`, the `uv tool install`
  alternative, Python 3.11+.
- Minimal usage example: the agent-connection snippet
  (`claude mcp add lore -- rac mcp` plus the `mcpServers` JSON block).
- Common commands: the three-line CLI block
  (`rac validate` / `rac inspect` / `rac review`).
- "Who it's for" (intended users), condensed to its three bullets.
- A Documentation section that links to the site: one prominent site link,
  plus the three primary entry points (Quickstart, MCP Server, CLI
  Reference) as site URLs rather than GitHub blob URLs.
- Project status and License.

**Moves to the site (landing page):**

- "Why this works" — wireframe section 5.
- "How this relates to spec-driven development" with the comparison table
  and its sources comment — wireframe section 6.
- "How Lore earns trust" — wireframe section 7.
- The long-form "Grounding your agent" narrative (the step framing and the
  worked soft-delete example); the README keeps only the bare connection
  snippet, and the full walkthrough remains `docs/mcp.md`.
- The 90-second-demo placeholder link — wireframe section 1 territory,
  added when the demo exists.

**Deleted from README (already owned elsewhere, not moved):**

- The "Supported artifact types" five-bullet list — `docs/artifacts.md` owns
  this; the README's product summary keeps the one-line enumeration of the
  five types.
- Per-page GitHub blob links to docs files — replaced by site links.

### Phase 2 handoff

The requirement artifacts expected from this scope, for the Phase 2 agent
(final grouping is Phase 2's call, bounded by this list):

1. Landing page (wireframe sections, branding assets, above-the-fold
   contract).
2. Docs site (Material theme, nav per site map, search, sourced from
   `docs/` unrewritten).
3. Publish pipeline (Actions → Pages, strict build as the gate).
4. README doorway + drift policy (ADR-022 shape, including the ADR-022
   amendment/companion decision).

## Constraints

- MkDocs + Material only; no other generators, plugins beyond the built-in
  search, or dependencies beyond `mkdocs` and `mkdocs-material` (pinned).
- Existing `docs/` pages are not rewritten; the only permitted edits are the
  seven link conversions the strict build requires.
- One landing page and one docs section. No blog, versioned docs, analytics,
  custom domain, or i18n (see Deferred items).
- Deployment exclusively via GitHub Actions to GitHub Pages from this
  repository; no external hosting, no `gh-pages` branch.
- ADR-022 documentation boundaries hold: README = doorway, `docs/` =
  user documentation (now also the site source), `rac/` = product knowledge
  corpus, which the site does not publish.
- Repository Markdown remains authoritative; the site is a generated view
  and is never edited directly.
- **Drift-prevention policy:** the site is generated only from `docs/`. The
  README contains nothing that also appears on the site except the install
  command, the tagline, and the minimal usage example and common commands
  that ADR-022 requires the doorway to carry. The README's documentation
  links point only at the site, so site nav changes cannot strand README
  links. Every section relocated from the README lives in exactly one place
  (`docs/index.md`) and must not regrow in the README. Phase 2 encodes this
  policy in the ADR-022 amendment so it is enforceable, not folklore.

## Rationale

- **ADR-022's README shape over the brief's stricter cut:** recorded
  decisions take precedence over inferred or imported conventions, and the
  maintainer confirmed the ruling. The README stays a doorway a reader can
  absorb in a minute, but a doorway with a usage example converts better
  than a bare link.
- **Flat nav over grouped nav:** ten pages do not need section headers, and
  a flat sidebar matches the "one docs section" constraint with zero
  configuration cleverness.
- **Link conversion to absolute GitHub URLs** (rather than excluding pages
  or copying `rac/` content into `docs/`): keeps the strict build green
  without violating either the no-rewrite constraint or the ADR-022 boundary
  that the corpus is not user documentation.
- **Copying the header images into `docs/images/`** rather than pointing the
  site at raw GitHub URLs: site assets should build from the docs dir so the
  build is self-contained and strict mode can verify them. The duplication
  risk is accepted — header art changes rarely, and both copies change in
  the same PR when it does.

## Alternatives

- **Brief-literal minimal README** (badges, one paragraph, install, link):
  rejected — conflicts with ADR-022 and REQ-Documentation-Structure;
  maintainer ruled for the recorded decision.
- **Custom HTML/CSS landing page** mimicking openspec.dev closely: rejected
  as the default — stock Material home first; custom overrides only if a
  Phase 2 acceptance criterion is unreachable without them, kept to one
  override file.
- **`mkdocs gh-deploy` / `gh-pages` branch deployment:** rejected — the
  official Pages actions deploy from a build artifact, need no long-lived
  branch, and match GitHub's current recommended model.
- **Publishing `rac/` on the site** for maximum dogfooding: rejected —
  ADR-022 explicitly rejected exposing the corpus as user documentation;
  the site dogfoods by being governed by artifacts, not by publishing them.

## Accessibility

- Hero images carry the existing descriptive alt text; the install command
  and tagline are real text, never baked into images.
- Light and dark header variants follow the Material palette toggle so
  contrast holds in both schemes; otherwise stock Material palettes (which
  meet contrast defaults) — no custom colors in scope.
- Search and nav are Material built-ins and remain keyboard-operable;
  nothing in scope adds custom interactive elements.

## Style Guidance

- Per ADR-036: the landing page leads with **Lore**; docs pages keep their
  existing RAC voice and titles unedited. The site title is "Lore"; the
  repository link makes the `rac` package identity visible.
- Stock Material look: default typography and components; the only brand
  elements are the existing header art and tagline. No mascot, no custom
  fonts, no palette beyond light/dark.
- Copy relocated from the README moves verbatim; the landing page is
  assembled from existing sentences, not rewritten marketing.

## Open Questions

1. **pyproject `Homepage` URL** — should it change from the GitHub repo to
   the new site once live? It alters published package metadata, so it is
   the maintainer's call and is not assumed in scope.
2. **Unused visual assets** — `docs/images/explorer-hero.svg` and
   `docs/images/rac-explorer-walkthrough.gif` are currently unreferenced.
   Should either appear on the site (e.g., the walkthrough GIF on the
   landing page), or do they stay dormant? Default if unanswered: dormant.
3. **Repo settings** (not a design question, but a maintainer-only step):
   enabling GitHub Pages with "GitHub Actions" as the source cannot be done
   from a PR and must be performed manually before first deploy.

## Deferred Items

Out of scope by decision; one sentence each:

- **Blog** — no news/announcement surface until there is a publishing cadence
  to justify one.
- **Versioned docs** — a single "latest" site is sufficient pre-v1.0.
- **Analytics** — no usage measurement on the site; telemetry posture stays
  as ADR-040/ADR-041 define it for the product.
- **Custom domain** — the site lives at the default
  `tcballard.github.io/requirements-as-code` address.
- **Internationalization** — English only.
