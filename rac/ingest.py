"""Convert source documents into Markdown.

`rac ingest <file>` turns an existing document (DOCX today; HTML/PDF later) into
Markdown so it can enter the RAC workflow. Ingestion's only job is **conversion
that preserves structure** — it does not judge whether the result is a valid RAC
artifact. That is the responsibility of future `inspect` / `normalize` commands.

Per ADR-008 (agent-ready architecture), the logic lives here as a reusable
service behind a :class:`DocumentConverter` abstraction; the CLI is a thin
wrapper. New sources (Notion, Confluence, PDF, ...) are added by registering
another converter — the CLI does not change.
