# RAC Major Release Gate Review

## Objective

Run a release gate review for a major RAC release — not to implement changes
— confirming the release stays in scope, architecturally coherent,
simplified, tested, documented, hygienic, and backward-compatible.

## Input

- RAC is a Markdown-first CLI for requirements-as-code.
- The system supports typed product artifacts such as Requirements,
  Decisions, Roadmaps, Designs, and related schema/template/improve/inspect/
  stats behavior.
- The product goal is deterministic artifact recognition, structural
  validation, useful CLI feedback, and stable JSON contracts.
- The release must not drift into project management, UI rendering, semantic
  scoring, AI interpretation, collaboration workflows, databases, accounts,
  or web-app behavior unless explicitly approved.
- The current repository and the state of the pending release.

## Instructions

Review the current repository against these gates.

### 1. Product scope gate

Identify anything in this release that exceeds the intended product
boundary. Check for: behavior that interprets artifact quality instead of
validating structure; workflow/project-management behavior; semantic
relationship analysis; UI/design-token/rendering behavior; hidden AI-like
inference; new concepts not documented in roadmap, ADRs, or release notes;
CLI behavior that surprises the user. Return PASS / BLOCK, exact files or
commands involved, and required scope cuts before release.

### 2. Architecture consistency gate

Review whether the artifact model is still coherent. Check whether
classification, validation, stats, schema, templates, inspect, and improve
use shared artifact metadata where possible; whether any artifact has
special-case logic that should be generalized; whether Roadmap, Design,
Decision, and Requirement behavior follow the same pattern; whether new code
duplicates existing artifact handling; whether any module is becoming too
large or coupled; whether public contracts are separated from
implementation details. Return PASS / BLOCK, duplicated paths, special cases
to remove, proposed simplification before release.

### 3. Duplication and deletion gate

A hard simplification review. Answer directly: What code became obsolete
during this release? What can be deleted before release? What logic was
copied instead of shared? Which artifact-specific branches can be collapsed
into generic artifact-spec-driven behavior? Did any file grow past a size
where it should be split? Are there old fixtures, examples, or docs that now
contradict the current model? Are there stale branches, roadmap files, or
TODOs to clean up? Return required deletions, optional cleanup, and changes
that should wait until after release.

### 4. CLI contract gate

Review every public command affected by this release (rac validate, diff,
stats, inspect, improve, schema, ingest if touched). For each, verify human
output is stable and understandable, JSON output is stable and documented,
exit codes are intentional, invalid input behavior is clear, warnings vs
errors are consistent, unsupported artifact behavior is explicit, and
examples in README/docs still work. Return a table:

```text
Command | Changed? | Human output ok? | JSON ok? | Exit codes ok? | Docs ok? | Blockers
```

### 5. Classification boundary gate

Review artifact classification behavior. Check that Requirements do not
classify as Design and vice versa; Roadmaps classify by approved structure,
not loose title matching alone except where intended; UI/design-themed
titles alone do not classify as Design; invalid but recognizable artifacts
classify correctly then fail validation separately; incomplete artifacts
behave per the spec; mixed documents do not produce surprising
classifications; negative fixtures exist for adjacent artifact types. Return
PASS / BLOCK, missing boundary tests, risky rules, recommended fixtures.

### 6. Validation and schema gate

Check that validation behavior and schema output agree. Verify required
sections match the artifact specs; recommended and optional sections are
consistent across schema, templates, validation, and docs; metadata
vocabularies are enforced consistently; missing required sections produce
clear errors; invalid metadata values produce clear errors; schema JSON is
stable and documented; template output follows canonical section order.
Return mismatches, missing tests, release blockers.

### 7. Test and verification gate

Do not accept "tests pass" as enough. Run or identify the exact commands
needed to verify the release. Check unit tests for changed behavior, CLI
smoke tests, classification boundary tests, negative fixtures, JSON output
snapshots or equivalent assertions, docs examples verified,
packaging/build check, and import check from a clean environment if
practical. Return exact commands run, exact commands still needed, failures,
missing test files, blockers. If tests are missing for new behavior, mark
the release BLOCKED.

### 8. Documentation gate

Review documentation from a new user's point of view. Check that README
reflects current commands; artifact docs match implementation; examples use
current output; a release note or changelog entry exists; ADRs are not
contradicted; the roadmap item is updated or marked complete;
install/publish instructions are accurate; known limitations are explicit.
Return stale docs, missing docs, docs that overpromise behavior.

### 9. Release hygiene gate

Check repository and release state. Verify the working tree is clean; the
release branch is based on current origin/main; merged branches are pruned
or listed for pruning; the version number is updated consistently; package
metadata is correct; no generated tool attribution appears in commits, PR
text, release notes, or docs; CI is green; build artifacts are not
accidentally committed; no credentials or local paths leaked. Return
PASS / BLOCK, exact commands to confirm state, required cleanup.

### 10. Backward compatibility and migration gate

Identify anything that could break existing users. Check command names,
arguments and flags, JSON field names, exit codes, artifact classification
behavior, validation strictness, package extras, import paths, and
documented examples. Return breaking changes, whether each is intentional, a
migration note if required, and a release blocker if undocumented.

## Output

Return the review in this structure:

```markdown
# Major Release Gate Review

## Decision
PASS or BLOCK

## Release blockers
List only issues that must be fixed before release.

## Required simplifications
List duplication, deletion, or extraction work required before release.

## Test evidence
List commands run and results. If not run, say NOT RUN.

## Product scope issues
List any behavior that exceeds the intended boundary.

## Architecture issues
List duplicated or inconsistent implementation paths.

## CLI contract issues
List command/output/JSON/exit-code problems.

## Documentation issues
List stale, missing, or overpromising docs.

## Release hygiene issues
List branch/version/CI/commit/publishing concerns.

## Safe to defer
List cleanup that is real but not release-blocking.

## Exact next actions
Give a short checklist of the next changes to make.
```

## Constraints

- Do not implement anything in this pass.
- Do not invent test results. If you did not run a command, mark it NOT RUN.
- Cite exact files and commands.
- Treat missing tests for new public behavior as a blocker.
- Treat duplicated artifact-specific logic that should be generalized as a
  required simplification.
