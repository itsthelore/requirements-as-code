"""Artifact type definitions — the shared schema source for RAC.

An *artifact* is a structured kind of knowledge (a Requirement, a Decision, ...)
recognized by the sections it contains. This module owns those definitions and
nothing else: `rac inspect` (v0.4) *consumes* them, and future capabilities
(`improve`, artifact-aware `validate`, `normalize`) will import the same specs so
there is a single source of truth.

Section names are normalized (stripped + casefolded) for matching; ``display``
holds the human-facing label.

Four artifact types have a concrete schema today: Requirement (RAC's own format /
validator), Decision (the ADR format used in this repository), Roadmap (outcome- and
initiative-focused knowledge, added in v0.6.0), and Prompt (structured AI prompts as
knowledge, added in v0.6.2). Meeting is intentionally deferred until its schema is
formalized — see planning/roadmap/.
