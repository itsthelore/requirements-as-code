"""Tests for `rac gate` — policy-aware unified enforcement (v0.21.14, ADR-049).

The gate composes validation, relationships, and review into one enforced verdict
under the corpus enforcement policy. These tests pin the contract that matters:

- with no policy, ``ok`` equals ``validate.ok AND relationships.ok AND
  review.ok`` (the v0.21.13 behaviour the policy refines);
- an ``advisory`` policy entry downgrades a blocking finding so the gate passes
  while the finding still annotates;
- an ``off`` entry drops a finding entirely;
- a malformed ``enforcement`` shape is rejected, not silently ignored;
- the JSON and SARIF envelopes are valid and deterministic.

Negative and boundary cases (a broken reference, an empty directory, adjacent
behaviour) are covered per the session-start prompt.
