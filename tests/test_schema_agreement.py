"""Single-schema cross-consumer agreement (v0.23.0, WS6).

The artifact schema is defined once in code (ADR-052, ADR-049): the front-matter
*envelope* (`_SUPPORTED_FIELDS` in `core/frontmatter.py`, `ArtifactMetadata` in
`core/metadata.py`) and the per-type *structure* (`ARTIFACT_SPECS` in
`core/artifacts.py`), with the relationship-kind vocabulary in
`RELATIONSHIP_SECTIONS` (`services/relationships.py`).

Four code paths consume that schema and must never drift from it:

- the **validator** — `spec_for`;
- the **four MCP serializers** — `get_artifact` / `search_artifacts` /
  `get_related` report a `type` produced by the classifier (`score_artifacts`),
  `get_summary` enumerates types via `build_portfolio_summary`, and `get_related`
  keys relationships by `RELATIONSHIP_SECTIONS`;
- the **TUI adapter** — `available_schemas` / `schema_reference`.

These tests assert each consumer derives its artifact types, status enums,
relationship kinds, and section sets from those single sources — *membership*,
not value formatting (REQ-003) — and fail loudly, naming the consumer and the
diverging field, when one drifts (REQ-004). They introduce no parallel schema
framework and depend on no fixture corpus (REQ-001/004).
