# CLI Reference

RAC ships a single command, `rac`, with ten subcommands. This page documents each
one: its purpose, inputs, outputs, and exit codes.

```bash
rac <command> [arguments] [options]
rac --version
rac <command> --help
```

## Conventions

These apply across every command.

- **`--json`** — most commands accept `--json` to emit machine-readable output
  instead of the human-readable report. JSON output is a stable contract intended
  for tools, IDEs, CI, and agents.
- **Standard input** — `validate`, `inspect`, and `improve` accept `-` in place of a
  file to read Markdown from stdin (e.g. `cat file.md | rac validate -`).
- **Recursion** — directory commands (`stats`, `inspect`, `relationships`,
  `portfolio`, `index`) recurse into subdirectories by default. Pass `--top-level`
  to scan only the immediate directory. `--recursive` is accepted explicitly for
  clarity but is already the default.
- **Exit codes** — every command follows the same convention:

  | Code | Meaning |
  | --- | --- |
  | `0` | Success |
  | `1` | Validation or relationship check failed |
  | `2` | Usage or I/O error (bad arguments, file not found, not a directory) |

---

## validate

Validate a single requirement file for structural and content issues.

- **Input:** `rac validate <file>` — a Markdown file, or `-` for stdin.
- **Options:** `--json`
- **Exit codes:** `0` no errors · `1` validation errors · `2` file not found / unreadable

```bash
rac validate login-flow.md
```

```text
PASS  login-flow.md
  warning [missing-risks] login-flow.md
          No ## Risks section (optional, but recommended).

0 error(s), 1 warning(s).
```

Warnings do not fail the run; only errors return exit `1`. Use `--json` for the
structured form (`valid`, `errors[]`, `warnings[]` with stable `code` fields).

> `validate` checks **one file**. For a whole tree, use [`stats`](#stats).

---

## diff

Compare two versions of a requirement file and report what changed.

- **Input:** `rac diff <old> <new>` — two Markdown files.
- **Options:** `--json`
- **Exit codes:** `0` success · `2` file not found / unreadable

```bash
rac diff examples/example_dashboard_v1.md examples/example_dashboard_v2.md
```

```text
Added Requirements

+ REQ-004 User can schedule a weekly usage summary email

Removed Requirements

- REQ-003 User can export the current chart as a CSV file

Modified Requirements

~ REQ-002
  Before: User can filter usage charts by date range
  After:  User can filter usage charts by date range and by team
```

---

## stats

Summarize a directory of artifacts: counts, quality signals, and per-type breakdowns.

- **Input:** `rac stats <directory>` — scanned recursively for `*.md`.
- **Options:** `--json`
- **Exit codes:** `0` analyzable content found · `1` no valid artifacts · `2` not a directory

```bash
rac stats rac/
```

Reports feature/requirement/decision/roadmap/design counts, missing recommended
sections, and a list of files that matched no schema (not errors — see
[ADR-010](artifacts.md#documents-vs-artifacts)).

---

## ingest

Convert a document (DOCX, PDF, HTML, PPTX, XLSX, or Markdown) into RAC-compatible
Markdown.

- **Input:** `rac ingest <file>` — the source document.
- **Options:** `-o, --output <path>` (write to a file; errors if it exists unless
  `--force`) · `--stdout` (explicit stdout, the default) · `--force` · `--json`
- **Exit codes:** `0` success · `1` conversion failed · `2` unsupported type / file not found / output exists without `--force`

```bash
rac ingest spec.docx                 # preview Markdown on stdout
rac ingest spec.docx -o spec.md      # write to a file
rac ingest report.pdf -o report.md --force
```

Conversion uses optional extras. Install the readers you need:
`pip install 'requirements-as-code[ingest]'` (DOCX/HTML), `[ingest-pdf]`,
`[ingest-office]` (PPTX/XLSX), or `[ingest-all]`.

---

## inspect

Identify a document's artifact type and which sections are present or missing. Works
on a single file or a whole directory.

- **Input:** `rac inspect <file|directory>` — or `-` for stdin (single file only).
- **Options:** `--json` · `--verbose` (classification breakdown and score, single
  file only) · `--top-level` · `--recursive`
- **Exit codes:** `0` (a completed inspection always succeeds — `Unknown` is a valid result)

```bash
rac inspect login-flow.md
rac inspect . --json            # aggregate type counts for a directory
```

```text
Artifact Type: Requirement
Confidence: 71%

Present Sections:
  ✓ Problem
  ✓ Requirements
  ✓ Success Metrics

Missing Sections:
  ✗ Risks
  ✗ Assumptions
```

---

## improve

Suggest the sections an artifact is missing, optionally as ready-to-paste templates.

- **Input:** `rac improve <file>` — or `-` for stdin.
- **Options:** `--json` *or* `--template` (mutually exclusive)
- **Exit codes:** `0` (suggestions are advice, not failure)

```bash
rac improve login-flow.md             # list missing sections
rac improve login-flow.md --template  # emit Markdown stubs to paste in
```

---

## schema

Show registered artifact schemas and starter templates.

- **Input:** `rac schema [name]` — `requirement`, `decision`, `roadmap`, `prompt`, or `design`.
- **Options:** `--list` (list all schema names) · `--json` *or* `--template`
  (mutually exclusive) · `--list` cannot be combined with a schema name
- **Exit codes:** `0` success · `2` unknown schema name or flag misuse

```bash
rac schema --list                  # the five artifact types
rac schema requirement             # required / recommended / optional sections
rac schema decision --template     # starter Markdown for a decision
rac schema roadmap --json          # machine-readable schema
```

---

## relationships

Inspect — and optionally validate — explicit references between artifacts in a file
or directory.

- **Input:** `rac relationships <path>` — a directory or a single Markdown file.
- **Options:** `--validate` (resolve every reference; exit `1` on any broken,
  ambiguous, self-referencing, or duplicate-identifier finding) · `--json` ·
  `--top-level` · `--recursive`
- **Exit codes:** `0` relationships found / all references valid · `1` validation
  issues · `2` path not found

```bash
rac relationships rac/              # list the references RAC discovered
rac relationships rac/ --validate   # check that every reference resolves
```

Finding no relationships is **not** an error. See [relationships.md](relationships.md)
for the issue codes `--validate` reports.

---

## portfolio

A one-screen repository intelligence summary: artifact counts by type, validity,
completeness, relationship coverage, an attention list, and a health score.

- **Input:** `rac portfolio <directory>` — scanned recursively for `*.md`.
- **Options:** `--json` · `--top-level` · `--recursive`
- **Exit codes:** `0` success · `2` not a directory

```bash
rac portfolio rac/
```

---

## index

Produce a flat inventory of every artifact — id, type, title, and path — so other
tools can build navigation without re-scanning files.

- **Input:** `rac index [directory]` — defaults to the current directory; scanned
  recursively for `*.md`.
- **Options:** `--json` · `--top-level` · `--recursive`
- **Exit codes:** `0` success · `2` not a directory

```bash
rac index rac/
rac index rac/ --json
```

```json
{
  "schema_version": "1",
  "directory": "rac/requirements/",
  "recursive": true,
  "artifact_count": 4,
  "artifacts": [
    {
      "id": "rac-documentation-structure",
      "type": "unknown",
      "title": "REQ-Documentation-Structure",
      "path": "rac/requirements/rac-documentation-structure.md"
    }
  ]
}
```
