"""Relationship-type registry — the edge schema for Layer-3 graph integrity (ADR-055).

Edge *legality by source type* (domain) stays where v0.14.0 put it:
``ArtifactSpec.optional`` (the sections a type may declare). This registry adds
the *graph* properties of each relationship kind — target type (``range``),
directionality, acyclicity, and whether the edge forbids a retired target — so
the Layer-3 checks (range, acyclicity, status-consistency) read one declarative
source instead of hard-coded special cases.

The registry is **code-defined**. Custom, repo-declared relationship types are
deferred (ADR-052 defers the analogous custom artifact types); the built-in
vocabulary is ``rac.services.relationships.RELATIONSHIP_SECTIONS`` keyed in its
snake_case form (``related_decisions``, ``supersedes``), matching the keys
``extract_relationships_full`` produces.

``range``, ``acyclic``, and ``forbids_target_status`` are enforced today.
``symmetric``/``inverse``/``cardinality`` are declared for display and forward
compatibility (a viewer can label inverse edges) and are not yet enforced.
