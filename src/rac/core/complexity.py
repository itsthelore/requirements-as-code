"""Deterministic prompt-complexity scoring and local/cloud routing (ADR-068).

Scores a prompt's *structural* complexity and maps it to a ``local`` / ``cloud``
routing recommendation against a threshold. Pure and AI-optional (ADR-002): it
reads only structural signals from the text — length, headings, steps, links,
code blocks, tables — with no model, key, or network. The result is a *fact*
(like classification confidence), never a semantic verdict about how hard the
prompt is, and RAC never invokes a model: the caller maps the recommendation
onto its own configured endpoints and runs inference (ADR-034, ADR-035).

The scoring shape mirrors :mod:`rac.core.classification`: each feature
contributes a weighted, saturating amount toward the total weight, so the score
is bounded to ``0.0 – 1.0`` and byte-stable for identical input and config. A
leading YAML frontmatter block is stripped first, so a stored Prompt artifact
and the same prompt text on stdin score identically.
