"""The anonymous daily ping — RAC's entire network surface (v0.10.5).

ADR-041 allows one transmission and pins it in full: with consent recorded
(:mod:`rac.consent`) and a PostHog key configured, the Guide server sends at
most one ping per 24 hours carrying a random install id, the RAC version, and
an active-repo count. Never repository contents, paths, artifact text,
queries, or tool arguments. Adding a field is a new recorded decision.

This is the only module in RAC permitted to import ``urllib.request`` — the
isolation battery enforces it — so "what does RAC phone home" is answerable
by reading one file.

Fire-and-forget posture: a daemon thread started by ``run_server``, a
three-second socket timeout, every exception swallowed, no retries, no
queueing. The 24-hour marker is written after each attempt regardless of
outcome, so a failing endpoint costs one attempt per day, never a storm. The
ping runs outside the request/response contract (ADR-032): nothing it reads
or writes ever feeds a tool response.

Active repos are counted locally: each served repository root is recorded as
a salted digest (the per-install salt from the consent record, never
transmitted) with a last-seen date, pruned to a thirty-day window. Only the
count crosses the wire.
