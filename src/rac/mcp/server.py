"""RAC Guide MCP server — the four-tool surface (v0.10.0).

This module is the FastMCP application: it builds a server bound to a
repository root and registers the four read-only tools the
``guide-tool-surface`` design pins (``get_artifact``, ``search_artifacts``,
``get_related``, ``get_summary``). Tool descriptions ship verbatim from that
design; changing them is a contract change (ADR-030).

The server is a *consumer* of RAC Core (ADR-015, ADR-031): every tool calls
read-only service functions — resolution, search, relationships, portfolio —
and shapes their results for the wire. It re-implements no parsing, resolution,
relationship extraction, or scoring, and imports no write-capable service. The
isolation battery (``tests/test_mcp_isolation.py``) enforces both.

Every tool call re-reads the repository from disk (ADR-032): there is no cache,
no file watcher, and no session state. Identical repository bytes and identical
input produce identical output, within the per-response character budget
(ADR-033, see :mod:`rac.mcp.budget`).

Failed lookups return structured error data, never protocol exceptions
(ADR-034, :mod:`rac.mcp.errors`): an agent recovers from a JSON body.

Startup diagnostics (v0.10.1): ``run_server`` writes a one-line notice to
stderr when the repository root contains no recognized artifacts, so the first
run against a misconfigured or empty root fails helpfully rather than silently.
stdout belongs to the MCP protocol; only stderr carries diagnostics.
