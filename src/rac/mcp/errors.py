"""Structured error shapes for Guide tools (v0.10.0).

Failed lookups are returned as data, never raised as protocol exceptions: an
agent recovers from a JSON body, not from a transport error (ADR-034 reasoning
boundary, ADR-007 contract stability). The shapes here are the resolver's own
outcomes (``not-found``, ``duplicate``) rendered for the tool surface, matching
``ResolutionResult.to_dict`` byte-for-byte so a Guide error is the same error
``rac resolve --json`` emits.

The server layer constructs these from a :class:`~rac.services.resolve.ResolutionResult`
rather than re-deriving them, keeping resolution semantics in Core (ADR-031).
