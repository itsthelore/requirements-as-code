"""Explorer adapter — the boundary between RAC services and the TUI (v0.8.0).

The adapter invokes RAC services, translates Core models into UI state, and
owns no repository intelligence (ADR-015). It is the single place the
Explorer touches ``rac.services`` / ``rac.core``; widgets depend on
:mod:`rac.explorer.state` only. This module never imports Textual, so it is
testable without a terminal.
