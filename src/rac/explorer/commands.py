"""Explorer command registry and routing (v0.8.1, DESIGN-command-surface).

The `/` surface is backed by this single registry: an action not registered
here is not discoverable. Routing is the only logic that lives in Explorer —
every answer comes from Core services through the adapter (ADR-015).

Search and commands share the one entry point: input whose first word is not
a registered command name is a search, so users never have to decide which
they are doing. This module imports neither Textual nor Core, keeping the
routing unit-testable without a terminal.
