"""Usage-sharing consent — opt-in twice over, anonymous by construction (v0.10.5).

ADR-041 allows RAC one anonymous daily ping, and only with consent recorded
here. The record lives as JSON under ``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/rac/telemetry.json``
with the Explorer-preferences posture: a missing or corrupt file means no
consent, loading never raises, and saving tolerates filesystem trouble
silently — a machine where consent cannot be persisted is a machine that
shares nothing.

The install id is random (``secrets.token_hex(16)``), minted at opt-in and
preserved across off-and-on toggles so the retention curve stays continuous.
Random beats a salted hash of machine attributes because it derives from
nothing (ADR-041). The separate ``salt`` digests repository paths for the
local active-repo count and never leaves the machine.

Either answer to the ``rac init`` prompt is persisted — including a decline —
so the question is asked at most once per machine: :func:`consent_recorded`
is the gate, not the answer.

This module lives outside ``rac.mcp`` because importing that package pays the
MCP SDK import, and ``rac init`` / ``rac telemetry`` must stay SDK-free. The
PostHog constants live here for the same reason — they are inert strings; the
only network code in RAC is :mod:`rac.mcp.ping`.
