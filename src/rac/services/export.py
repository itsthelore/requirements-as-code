"""Corpus export — `rac export` (v0.11.0).

``build_corpus_export`` walks a directory once and composes existing Core
services — corpus traversal, identity/aliases, relationship extraction and
resolution — into one deterministic :class:`CorpusExport` payload for the
Portal, the read-only HTML viewer (ADR-014: artifacts stay viewer-agnostic;
exports are how external viewers consume a corpus; ADR-012: export lives in
the open-source core). The payload shape is a stable public contract
(ADR-007), reconciled with ``lore-web/VIEWER_CONTRACT.md`` v1.

Determinism (ADR-002): no timestamps, no environment-dependent fields,
artifacts in sorted-path order, relationships sorted by ``(from, to)`` —
two exports of the same tree are byte-identical.

Pinned semantics (the viewer treats both fields as open sets):

- ``status`` is the first non-empty line of the artifact's ``## Status``
  section, canonicalized against the type's declared metadata values exactly
  as ``rac inspect`` does (so a decision's ``accepted`` exports as
  ``Accepted``). ``rac inspect`` *omits* a missing status; the export
  contract requires a string, so an absent or empty section exports as
  ``"unknown"``.
- ``title`` is the document title; an untitled artifact falls back to its
  canonical identifier (``rac index`` emits ``null`` there, but the viewer
  contract pins ``title`` as a string).
- ``body_html`` is the Markdown body after the frontmatter envelope,
  rendered by the vendored ``markdown-it-py`` CommonMark preset with raw
  HTML *disabled*: HTML in sources is escaped, not executed (the Portal
  trust model in VIEWER_CONTRACT.md depends on this).
- Unknown-type files are not exported (classification is the gate, matching
  the skip semantics of directory validation); invalid but *recognizable*
  artifacts export as classified — classification stays separate from
  validation.
- Relationships are untyped ``relates-to`` edges. ``to`` is the target's
  canonical identifier when the reference resolves uniquely through the same
  alias index relationship validation uses; otherwise the literal reference
  text is preserved verbatim (ADR-016: the line text *is* the reference).
