"""Artifact improvement — deterministic, schema-driven guidance (ADR-002).

`rac improve <file>` is RAC's *advisory* capability: it reports which required and
recommended sections an artifact is missing, explains *how to complete them* with
schema-defined guidance (v0.5.1), and can emit Markdown templates. It is strictly
read-only (REQ-004) and generates no content beyond schema-derived placeholders —
no AI, no rewriting.

Improvement depends only on the artifact *type* and a *schema comparison*
(:func:`rac.core.classification.missing_sections`); it never reaches into classification
confidence internals. A type is *supported* when it has an :class:`ArtifactSpec`
**and** complete guidance coverage for its expected sections — so requirement and
decision are supported today, while Unknown (and any future spec lacking guidance)
is not. Guidance is informational only: it never affects classification, validation,
or statistics.
