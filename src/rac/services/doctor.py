"""Repository health diagnostic — `rac doctor` (v0.23.0, WS3).

One front door for corpus health. RAC already *detects* most defects, but across
three commands a new adopter must know to chain. `doctor` runs them in one pass
and returns a single verdict with a paste-ready fix per finding, reusing the
existing services rather than re-deriving any defect class they already own
(ADR-049, ADR-055, ADR-060):

- structural validity, from :func:`rac.services.validate.validate_directory`;
- relationship integrity (broken / ambiguous / self / type-mismatch / retired /
  duplicate-id / cyclic), from
  :func:`rac.services.relationships.validate_relationships`.

It adds only the two diagnostics no command provides (REQ-002): **high-fan-out
hubs** (a node whose inbound-plus-outbound resolved-edge degree exceeds a
configurable threshold) and a heuristic **injection-style content** flag for
human review (REQ-005). Orphans are derived from the same one-hop degree pass
and match the portfolio's "never a resolved target" count exactly (a test pins
this), so the signal cannot drift from the service that owns it.

Everything is deterministic and offline (ADR-002, ADR-034, ADR-066): no AI, no
network, byte-identical output across runs on an unchanged corpus. `doctor`
never edits content — the injection flag is a reviewable WARNING, never a
hard-fail or an auto-edit, and makes no safety claim; the trust boundary stays
human PR review (ADR-065). It exits non-zero only on a validation or
relationship-integrity *error*; warnings (orphans, hubs, injection) exit zero
(REQ-007).
